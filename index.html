    Hello world!<br>
    Das ist <b>wirklich</b> umglaublich!<br>
    <hr>
  There is nothing else than just a wave after wave.

From the old lookout tower, from this weather-beaten wooden structure with its creaking joints, 
    sun-paled beams, and the long, dependable shadow it casts across the pebbled ground every 
    morning, from here we see the softened edges of the fields. 
    You will not be lost or left out; perhaps you will not even be cut down, 
    standing there like a cautious wanderer who knows the paths by heart. 
    You will not seek your ploy under the trees, those ordinary village trees 
    whose branches grow with the slow patience of years; the red smoke is unknown to your bells, 
    the simple brass bells that have hung in quiet entryways for decades.
